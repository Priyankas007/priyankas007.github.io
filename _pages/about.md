Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a masterâ€™s student at Stanford University, studying computer science on the artificial intelligence track. In 2024, I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree from Stanford, specializing in computer science with a focus on biocomputation. My undergraduate honors thesis, "Nearest Neighbors Nonnegative Spatial Factorization to Study Spatial and Temporal Transcriptomics", explored optimization and dimensionality reduction approaches in spatial and temporal data analysis utilizing Gaussian processes.

Currently, Iâ€™m a research assistant with Dr. Barbara Engelhardt at the Stanford Biomedical Data Science Department and the Gladstone Institutes, where I develop computational algorithms for spatial transcriptomics datasets. My journey also includes  research experiences with Dr. Aaron Meyer at UCLAâ€™s Department of Bioengineering through the Amgen Scholars program and time as a Software Engineer for the biotech company, Roche.

Iâ€™m passionate about the intersection of technology and medicine, with a special fascination for genomics and its transformative potential in cancer care. Whether it's designing algorithms or tackling big questions in healthcare, Iâ€™m driven by the idea of using AI to unlock new possibilities in medicine. I also love storytelling, and along the way added on a minor in creative writing and dabbled in podcasting. I love chatting! Reach me at shrestp[at]stanford[dot]edu.
