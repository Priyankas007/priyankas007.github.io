  <h2>About Me üë©üèª‚Äçüíª üß¨ üñãÔ∏è</h2>
  <p>üëã Hi there! I'm the co-founder and CTO of Galen AI, a health tech company putting medical data and insights directly into the hands of patients (we were covered by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/y-combinator-yc-demo-day-spring-ai-agent-startups-2025-6">Business Insider!</a>). I recently graduated with my M.S. in Computer Science on the AI track from Stanford University in 2025. In 2024, I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from Stanford, specializing in biocomputation. My undergraduate honors thesis, Nearest Neighbors Nonnegative Spatial Factorization to Study Spatial and Temporal Transcriptomics, explored optimization and dimensionality reduction approaches in spatial and temporal data analysis using Gaussian processes.

<p>At Stanford, I served as a research assistant with <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/barbara-engelhardt">Dr. Barbara Engelhardt</a> at the Biomedical Data Science Department and Gladstone Institutes, where I developed computational algorithms for spatial transcriptomics.</p>

<p>Previously, I worked with <a href="https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/aaron-meyer/">Dr. Aaron Meyer</a> at UCLA through the Amgen Scholars program to model antibody binding, and at the Cleveland Clinic on data analysis projects related to COVID vaccination. Most recently, I led the design and development of AI-enabled bioinformatics data storage solutions as a software engineer at Roche.</p> 

<p>Whether it's designing algorithms, building products, or leading teams, I'm driven by the idea of using AI to unlock new possibilities in medicine. Reach me at priyanka[at]galenai[dot]com!</p>

  <h2>Stories</h2>
  <p>
    I love writing and storytelling (I have a minor in creative writing!). In 2022, I traveled around the U.S. interviewing first- and second-generation Nepali immigrants, compiling their stories into a project titled <a href="https://www.hamrokathacollection.com/">HAMRO KATHA</a>. Currently, I am working on a podcast about digital medicine and the impact of telehealth on the physician-patient relationship. You can find a work-in-progress <a href="https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-vgtbc-17736d9?action=openEpisode&episodeId=pb24590041&episodeIdTag=vgtbc&podcastId=pbblog19813022&podcastIdTag=2b9hh&utm_campaign=admin_episode&utm_medium=dlink&utm_source=episode_share">here</a>!

    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
    I like making and building. Here's some cool stuff I've made for classes and for fun.
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      <img src="/images/hip_tracks_logo.png" alt="HipTracks App Logo" style="width: 15%; max-width: 100px; margin-right: 15px;">
      <div>
      <h3>HipTracks</h3>
        <p>
          I helped develop an iOS app that uses biometric data from the Apple watch and AI to monitor hip and knee replacement patients post-operatively. My team won first place at the HealthHacks hackathon.
        </p>

    <h3>MCAT Mate</h3>
    <p>
      I utilized research from spaced repetition strategies to create a website for students to design and manage MCAT exam study schedules. I developed custom REST APIs & backend client-server protocol with Node.js and integrated a MongoDB database to manage user data/tasks. I implemented a fully functional user interface with accessibility features like a colorblind-friendly palette and alt text for enhanced usability.
    </p>
      <h3>Computer Vision for Colorectal Cancer</h3>
    <p>
      We utilized an image-based, multimodal graph convolutional neural network (SpaGCN) to cluster and profile the genomic makeup of colorectal cancer tumors from a spatial transcriptomics dataset achieving an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) score of 0.48. To improve profiling, we modified the SpaGCN architecture in the following ways: (1) Developed a novel pixel distance decay weighting, and (2) implemented semi-supervised learning using pathologist annotations and (3)Jensen-Shannon divergence loss. We showed a 93% improvement in model performance from current state-of-the-art.

  <h2>Life üåü</h2>
  <p>
    Outside of school and work I enjoy writing, dancing, and skateboarding! I danced competitively for four years and captained a <a herf="https://basmatiraas.wixsite.com/stanford">Garba Raas dance team</a> in college. We traveled and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0qfBkuKii4">performed</a> and had a good time :)
