  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
  Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a masterâ€™s student at Stanford University, studying computer science on the artificial intelligence track. In 2024, I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree from Stanford, specializing in computer science with a focus on biocomputation. My undergraduate honors thesis, "Nearest Neighbors Nonnegative Spatial Factorization to Study Spatial and Temporal Transcriptomics", explored optimization and dimensionality reduction approaches in spatial and temporal data analysis utilizing Gaussian processes.

  Currently, Iâ€™m a research assistant with <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/barbara-engelhardt">Dr. Barbara Engelhardt</a> at the Stanford Biomedical Data Science Department and the Gladstone Institutes, where I develop computational algorithms for spatial transcriptomics datasets. In the past, I've worked with Dr. Aaron Meyer to develop a binding model for antibodies at UCLAâ€™s Department of Bioengineering through the Amgen Scholars program. Most recently, I have led the design and development of bioinformatics data storage solutions as a software engineer at Roche.

  Iâ€™m passionate about the intersection of technology and medicine, with a special fascination for genomics and its transformative potential in cancer care. Whether it's designing algorithms or tackling big questions in healthcare, Iâ€™m driven by the idea of using AI to unlock new possibilities in medicine. I also love storytelling, and along the way added on a minor in creative writing and dabbled in podcasting. Reach me at shrestp[at]stanford[dot]edu!
